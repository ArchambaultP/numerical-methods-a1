      Example: Nothing to report here, really.
      Test: This function is is tested in tests/test_example.py
            This test just gives you a bonus, yay!
      Hint: The functions below have to be implemented in Python, without
            using any function from numpy.linalg. In each function, a

            function must do (Task), gives an example of output 
            (Example), explains how it will be evaluated (Test), and 
            may give you some hints (Hint).
