# Assignment instructions

## Preliminaries

Important preliminary notes:

* The requested tasks, described below, are all evaluated with a test
  executed with [pytest](http://pytest.org). Your assignment will be graded
  directly from the result of those tests, see details
  [here](./README.md). You may want to get familiar with pytest before
  starting.
  
* The tests contain examples of expected outputs that you may want to
  check in case the instruction below are unclear. Every detail in
  your answer counts! In particular, you should pay attention to the
  exact syntax of the expected output: add quotes around your answer
  and the tests won't pass!

* Your answers to the tasks below *must* be implemented in functions `answers.py`. 

* Unless otherwise specified, you are not allowed to use functions of 
the `numpy.linalg` module or any other library to implement your solution.

## 1. Python intro

We will start with a few tasks to help you get familiar with the 
development environment.

### Task

Write a function `check_square` that takes a `numpy` array and returns True if the
array represents a square matrix, and False otherwise.

### Required syntax

### Test

## 2. Crout's LU decomposition

## 3. Gauss decomposition

## 4. 

## Gauss with pivoting
